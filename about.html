        <p class="aboutme">I am a graphic designer, illustrator and photographer. You'll either find me working on a project, hiking, nose deep in a book or battling my cat for my desk chair.</p>
        <p>I collect graphic novels, pens and fuzzy blankets. I need supervision while shopping at Chapters, Michaels and Ikea. My goal is to one day work on a graphic novel and to be able to code a website without crying.</p>
